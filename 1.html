Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you never been
But all the things that you've seen
will slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
cos you set the brains I have went to my head
step outside summertimes in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off you face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

So sally can wait
she knows it's too late
and she's walking on by
her soul slides away
we don't look back in anger
I heard you say

take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands
of a Ronk n Roll band
will throw it all away

gonna start a revolution from my bed
cos you said the brains I had went to my head
step outside cos summertimes in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off you face
cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

and so sally can wait
she knows it's too late
and she's walking on by
my soul slides away
we don't look back in anger
I heard you say
